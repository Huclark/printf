## About

The `printf` function is function in the C - programming standard library which is used for formatted output. It stands for `print formatted`. The `printf` function basically allows the user to print text and data to standard output in a structured and formatted way.
This project aims to replicate the standard `printf` function.

## Objective

- The essence of this project is for you to put into practice all the concepts 
that you have been introduced to so far and see how they all work 
together in a real world use case.
- Develop a custom `_printf()` function that emulates the functionality 
of the standard library function `printf()`.
- Deepen your understanding of the C programming language.

## Features

- Processes Format Specifiers such as `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, etc, including custom format specifiers which cannot be used with the standard `printf` function.
- Deals with format string errors, handles argument mismatches and returns error codes or handling exceptions.
- Handles different data types.
- Optimized performance and efficiency
